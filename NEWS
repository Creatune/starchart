115 (v12)
Stable 1.2 release 2010/04/21
* Improved stars1.py catalog.
* Changed the algorithm of the "Identify" feature so that an extended object is favored
  over point objects that it hides in the plot.  (Example: M42 is found whereas some of
  the stars embedded in it used to be found instead.)  Unfortunately, for large extended
  objects an invisible point object may still be indentified if the user clicks
  sufficiently far from the center of the extended object.
* Added dso2.py which is a catalog of the larger, brighter Bennett objects (analagous to
  the Messier objects but in the southern skies) and the NGC objects not otherwise
  catalogged which have common names.
* Added the ability to display a magnified view corresponding to what would be seen
  through typical 7-power binoculars.  In order to show the sky as it would appear with
  binoculars, I also added a supplemental star catalog that adds about 2500 stars which
  are too dim to see without an instrument (stars2.py).  These stars are taken from the
  SAO catalog.
* Removed the radio button for magnitude 0 -- there are too few stars brighter than
  magnitude 1 for it to be useful to distinguish the mag 1 stars from the mag 0 stars.
* Re-arranged controls on the "What" and "Where" toolbars so that the controls still
  fit if Spanish localization is applied.
These additions bring the feature set up to what I have planned; the program is now
finished (unless I get bug reports or compelling requests for additional capabilities).
